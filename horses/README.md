# horses
Program to handle stats of minecraft horses.  The stats can be calculated/measured and then kept in a database.
By using this tool, we can better manage stats of the herd to breed the most perfect horse possible.

### How is this done?
A minecraft horse has three stats: Health, Jump, and Speed. 
The stats of a horse can be measured in game based on how many hearts it has, how high it can jump, and how fast it can run.
A horse can be a randomly generated mob or bred by two horses into a foal (baby horse :D).
